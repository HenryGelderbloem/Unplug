# Unplug

Welcome to Unplug!

Unplug is a macOS application that helps you reduce your impact on the environment just by unplugging your MacBook. Unplug uses data from the Nation Grid to determine when to unplug your MacBook, helping to reduce your carbon footprint.

Although your footprint reduction may be small, collectively, we can make a huge impact.
